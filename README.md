# es6-template

This should be a working starting point for es6 development with export to es5.

Goal

* Simple
* npm as build tool
* No worries about transpiling if possible

Just fork, rename, update package.json and start.

# Commands

* test - mocha
* test:watch - watches for changes / dev mode
* docs - generates api.md
* changelog - appends changes to the changelog
* jscs - checks style
* docs: site docs into ./out
